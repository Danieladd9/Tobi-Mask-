# Assignment 2: Make a reverse-engineered Snap Lens

Here are the requirements: 

1. VARIABLES: Activate at least one change in p5.js (display an image,run an animation,change the screen in some way, etc.) based on a poseNet keypoint position in ml5 (this is an object with a x and y property).
2. EVENTS: Activate at least one change in p5.js based on an event in ml5 (if you raise your hand, or if you make a certain gesture, etc.). 

## Here are the templates in this repo that you can use!

2. ![Body Lens using PoseNet](./script_posenet.js)
3. ![Face Lens using Face API](./script_faceapi.js)
